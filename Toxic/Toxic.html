        All my friends are toxic<br>
        All ambitionless, so rude and always negative<br>
        I need new friends<br>
        But it's not that quick and easy<br>
        Oh, I'm drowning, let me breathe<br>
        <br>
        I'm better off all by myself<br>
        Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else<br>
        Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help<br>
        But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone<br>
        Oh, you don't know, how it feels to be alone<br>
        Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh<br>
        <br>
        (I'm drowning, let me breathe)<br>
        (I'm drowning, let me breathe)<br>
        (I'm drowning, let me breathe)<br>
        (I'm drowning, let me breathe)<br>
        <br>
        But life is immaculate<br>
        Backin' it up a bit<br>
        Countin' my hours and knocking on wood<br>
        Avoiding my opposites<br>
        Chewin' on chocolate<br>
        Had a bit limited time but I should<br>
        Be good for a minute<br>
        Don't want to admit it<br>
        I'm running on seconds<br>
        I'm rigid, I'm screwed<br>
        Don't know what to do<br>
        I'm thinking of you<br>
        I'm drinking up bottles and bottles of booze<br>
        <br>
        I'm better off all by myself<br>
        Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else<br>
        Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help<br>
        But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone<br>
        Oh, you don't know, how it feels to be alone<br>
        Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh<br>
        <br>
        I fell into your river<br>
        That's where you told me lies<br>
        You said that I'd feel better<br>
        But this is where good guys die<br>
        You took my pride away<br>
        But you cannot take my light<br>
        I'll find another way out<br>
        But now you're taking my life<br>
        Don't you see how Iâ€”<br>
        <br>
        I'm better off all by myself<br>
        Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else<br>
        Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help<br>
        But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone<br>
        Oh, you don't know, how it feels to be alone<br>
        Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh<br>
        I'm better off all by myself<br>
        Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else<br>
        Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help<br>
        But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone<br>
        Oh, you don't know, how it feels to be alone<br>
        Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh
